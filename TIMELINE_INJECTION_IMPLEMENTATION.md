# Timeline Injection Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully integrated the `timeline_injector` module into the Corgi Recommender Service, providing a robust and configurable system for blending real Mastodon posts with injectable synthetic or recommended content.

## Implementation Details

1. **New API Endpoint**: Created `/api/v1/timelines/home` in `routes/timeline.py` that handles:
   - Retrieving real posts from upstream Mastodon instances
   - Loading injectable posts based on user session state
   - Applying configurable injection strategies
   - Blending the timelines and preserving chronological order

2. **Injectable Post Sources**:
   - For anonymous users: Cold start data from `data/cold_start_formatted.json`
   - For authenticated users: Personalized recommendations (stubbed for now)
   - For synthetic/validator users: Cold start data with special processing

3. **Injection Strategies**:
   - `uniform`: Evenly distributes injected posts throughout the timeline
   - `after_n`: Inserts an injected post after every N real posts
   - `first_only`: Only injects posts in the first portion of the timeline
   - `tag_match`: Inserts posts after real posts that have matching hashtags

4. **User-Adaptive Behavior**:
   - Automatically selects appropriate strategies based on user state
   - Provides overrides via query parameters for testing/debugging
   - Falls back gracefully when posts aren't available

5. **Metadata and Flags**:
   - Injected posts are marked with `"injected": true`
   - Response includes detailed metadata about the injection process
   - Clients can use this information for specialized rendering

6. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Logs injection attempts, successes, and failures
   - Records metrics like processing time and injection counts
   - Provides structured data for monitoring and optimization

7. **Testing**:
   - Created unit tests in `tests/test_timeline.py`
   - Tests different strategies and error conditions
   - Mocks dependencies for consistent testing

8. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed API documentation in `docs/endpoints/timeline_injection.md`
   - Documented all parameters, strategies, and response formats
   - Provided guidance on client-side integration

## Integration Points

The implementation cleanly integrates with the existing codebase:
- Registered the new blueprint in `app.py`
- Reused authentication and user handling from the proxy routes
- Maintained Mastodon API compatibility
- Added structured logging consistent with the application

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. Implementing real personalized recommendations instead of the stub
2. Adding more sophisticated injection strategies
3. Collecting feedback on injected posts to improve recommendations
4. Adding A/B testing capabilities for different injection strategies
5. Implementing advanced analytics for injection performance
