# Security Fixes Applied to Corgi Recommender Service

This document outlines security issues that were identified and fixed in the Corgi Recommender Service.

## 1. Fixed Hardcoded Credentials/Secrets

- **fix_token.py**: Removed hardcoded token `"YOUR_ELK_TOKEN"` and replaced it with dynamically generated token.
- **oauth.py**: Replaced hardcoded client ID with environment variable `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` with fallback to randomly generated ID for development.
- **config.py**: Removed default database credentials in DB_CONFIG and added a more robust fallback mechanism:
  - In production: Requires proper credentials to be set as environment variables
  - In development: Falls back to system user authentication if credentials are not provided

## 2. Improved Authentication Security

- **proxy.py**: Restricted user_id from being passed in query parameters to only development mode with explicit opt-in (`ALLOW_QUERY_USER_ID=true`).
- **oauth.py**: Implemented proper token lifecycle management:
  - Added token expiration mechanism
  - Added token status validation on lookup
  - Implemented automatic cleanup of expired tokens
  - Added secure token storage class

## 3. Enhanced SQL Injection Protection

- **privacy.py**: Ensured consistent use of parameterized queries.
- Fixed inconsistent placeholder styles that could lead to confusion and vulnerabilities.

## 4. Added CSRF Protection

- **app.py**: Implemented CSRF token generation and validation:
  - Added a `csrf_protect` decorator for state-changing routes
  - Automatic CSRF token generation for sessions
  - Validation of CSRF tokens for POST/PUT/DELETE requests
  - Added token to response headers for JS clients

## 5. Improved CORS Configuration

- **app.py**: Enhanced CORS configuration with explicit headers and methods:
  - Restricted allowed headers
  - Explicitly defined allowed methods
  - Added explicit expose headers
  - Maintained strict origin validation

## 6. Enhanced Input Validation

- **interactions.py**: Added comprehensive input validation:
  - Type checking for all input parameters
  - Length constraints for string inputs
  - Whitelist validation for action types
  - Format validation for context data

## 7. Secured File Permissions for Logs

- **proxy.py**: Added secure file permissions for logs:
  - Restricted logs directory to user-only access (0700)
  - Set log files to user-only read/write (0600)
  - Added proper error handling for permission setting

## 8. URL Validation and Sanitization

- **proxy.py**: Implemented a robust URL validation and sanitization function:
  - Enforced HTTPS for all instance URLs
  - Added regex pattern validation for domain format
  - Blocked localhost URLs in production environments
  - Stripped path components from URLs

## 9. Enhanced Privacy Protection

- **privacy.py**: Improved user pseudonymization:
  - Used HMAC instead of simple concatenation
  - Added fallback mechanism for missing salt with appropriate warnings
  - Added production-specific error handling

## Remaining Recommendations

1. **Dependency Updates**:
   - Update outdated packages, especially `psycopg2-binary==2.9.6`
   - Implement regular dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Database Security**:
   - Consider using an ORM or query builder for consistent database access
   - Implement database connection pooling with timeouts and validation

3. **Authentication Improvements**:
   - Replace in-memory token storage with a persistent secure store in production
   - Implement a proper OAuth flow with token refresh capabilities
   - Add complete token revocation mechanism

4. **Content Security**:
   - Add comprehensive XSS protection with input sanitization
   - Add proper HTML output encoding

5. **Authorization**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add permission checks for all sensitive operations

6. **Monitoring & Auditing**:
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Set up alerts for potential security breaches

7. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Store all sensitive configuration in environment variables or a secrets manager
   - Implement configuration validation on startup
   - Add a secure default configuration template

8. **Secure Development Lifecycle**:
   - Implement pre-commit hooks for security checks
   - Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
   - Regular security audits of the codebase

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never hardcode credentials** - Use environment variables or secure credential storage
2. **Always validate input** - Treat all user input as potentially malicious
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries
4. **Set proper file permissions** - Restrict access to sensitive files
5. **Implement proper authentication** - Use standards-compliant authentication methods
6. **Validate URLs and file paths** - Never trust user-provided URLs or file paths
7. **Use HTTPS everywhere** - Never transmit sensitive data over unencrypted connections
8. **Implement CSRF protection** - Prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
9. **Set security headers** - Add defense-in-depth through browser security features
10. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update and audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
