## Usage

To launch the setup GUI:

```bash
make gui
```

This will start the Flask server with the GUI accessible at:

```
http://localhost:5001/setup
```

### Production Safety

The setup GUI is disabled by default in production for security. To enable:

1. Set the environment variable `ENABLE_SETUP_GUI=true` 
2. Or build Docker image with `--build-arg INCLUDE_SETUP_GUI=true`

```bash
# Enable temporarily
ENABLE_SETUP_GUI=true python -m flask --app app run

# For Docker
docker build -t corgi-recommender --build-arg INCLUDE_SETUP_GUI=true .
```

## Technical Details

The Setup GUI consists of:

1. **Flask Blueprint** (`routes/setup_gui.py`): Handles API endpoints for the GUI
2. **HTML/CSS/JS Interface** (`templates/setup.html`): Bootstrap-based UI with Font Awesome icons
3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/setup/api/health`: Check system health
   - `/setup/api/agent-profiles`: Get available agent profiles
   - `/setup/api/mastodon-instances`: Get Mastodon instances
   - `/setup/api/run-command`: Run system commands
   - `/setup/api/update-privacy`: Update privacy settings
   - `/setup/api/validation-results`: Get validation results

### One-Click Demo Flow

The "One-Click Demo" button provides a streamlined experience by:

1. Running the final-test suite to validate system health
2. Loading and displaying validation results
3. Automatically selecting the `tech_fan` agent profile
4. Launching the agent to demonstrate synthetic user interactions
5. Providing visual feedback throughout the process

This feature is ideal for presentations and quick demos as it provides a single-button solution to showcase the full functionality of the Corgi Recommender Service.

## Security Note

This GUI is intended for **local use only** during demos and does not implement authentication. Do not expose this interface publicly.
