## üî¨ **Research Workflows**

### **Scenario 1: Algorithm Comparison Study**

1. **Register Your Models**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Upload baseline (e.g., collaborative filtering)
   ‚Ä¢ Add your novel algorithm
   ‚Ä¢ Include paper references and hyperparameters
   ```

2. **Design A/B Test**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Set baseline as control (50% traffic)  
   ‚Ä¢ Set novel algorithm as treatment (50% traffic)
   ‚Ä¢ Define success metrics (CTR, engagement, etc.)
   ‚Ä¢ Set experiment duration (typically 2-4 weeks)
   ```

3. **Monitor Results**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Track real-time performance
   ‚Ä¢ Wait for statistical significance
   ‚Ä¢ Analyze lift and confidence intervals
   ```

### **Scenario 2: Hyperparameter Optimization**

1. **Register Model Variants**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Create versions with different hyperparameters
   ‚Ä¢ Use systematic naming (e.g., neural_cf_lr001, neural_cf_lr0001)
   ‚Ä¢ Document parameter changes
   ```

2. **Multi-arm Testing**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Split traffic across variants (25% each)
   ‚Ä¢ Monitor performance convergence
   ‚Ä¢ Identify optimal configurations
   ```

### **Scenario 3: Cold Start Analysis**

1. **Model Specialization**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Register content-based models for new users
   ‚Ä¢ Register collaborative models for established users
   ‚Ä¢ Tag appropriately (cold-start, warm-start)
   ```

2. **Segmented Testing**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Create experiments targeting user segments
   ‚Ä¢ Compare performance across different user types
   ```
