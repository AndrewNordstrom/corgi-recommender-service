# Vulnerability Remediation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to address the security vulnerabilities identified in the GitHub repository alerts.

## Critical & High Severity Issues

### 1. Next.js Vulnerabilities (Multiple Issues)
**Multiple vulnerabilities in Next.js including:**
- Critical: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware
- High: Next.js authorization bypass vulnerability
- High: Next.js Cache Poisoning
- High: Next.js Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions
- Moderate: Next.js Denial of Service with Server Actions
- Moderate: Denial of Service in Next.js image optimization

**Current version**: 14.3.0 (per frontend/package.json)

**Remediation**: 
```bash
cd frontend
npm update next@latest
```

**Recommendation**:
Update Next.js to the latest version (currently 14.4.x or newer) which should include all security patches for these vulnerabilities. Also ensure that next-auth is updated to the latest compatible version.

### 2. Gunicorn HTTP Request/Response Smuggling Vulnerability (High)
**Current version**: 22.0.0 (per requirements.txt)

**Remediation**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade gunicorn>=21.2.0
```

**Update requirements.txt**:
```
gunicorn>=21.2.0
```

**Recommendation**:
Update Gunicorn to the latest patched version. If specific version constraints are required for application compatibility, test thoroughly after updating.

## Cookie Vulnerability

### Cookie Accepts Out of Bounds Characters Vulnerability
**Affected dependency**: This likely relates to the cookie parser in Next.js or possibly a separate cookie library.

**Remediation**:
This may be fixed as part of the Next.js update. If a separate cookie library is used, that should be identified and updated separately.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create a staging/test environment** to test all updates before applying to production
2. **Update Next.js and related frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm update next@latest next-auth@latest
   ```
3. **Update Gunicorn**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade gunicorn>=21.2.0
   ```
4. **Update requirements.txt**:
   ```
   gunicorn>=21.2.0
   ```
5. **Run all tests** to ensure application functionality is not affected
6. **Deploy updates** to production after successful testing

## Long-Term Security Recommendations

1. **Implement Automated Dependency Scanning**:
   - Set up Dependabot alerts and automatic PR creation
   - Add OWASP Dependency Check to CI pipeline

2. **Regular Security Updates**:
   - Schedule regular dependency updates (monthly)
   - Prioritize security patches for immediate updates

3. **Security Headers and CSP**:
   - Implement proper Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Add other security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

4. **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**:
   - Create a security.md file with vulnerability reporting instructions
   - Set up a security@ email address for reporting

5. **Security Testing**:
   - Add security tests to CI/CD pipeline
   - Conduct regular penetration testing
