# Swagger UI Security Advisory

## Security Issues

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the current Swagger UI bundle:

1. Incomplete string escaping/encoding (High severity)
2. Overly permissive regular expression ranges (Medium severity)

## Recommended Action

Update Swagger UI to the latest version. The current version contains several security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited.

### Steps to Update:

1. Download the latest version of Swagger UI from: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases

2. Replace the following files:
   - swagger-ui-bundle.js
   - swagger-ui.css

3. Test that the Swagger UI interface is working correctly with the API documentation

## Additional Security Measures

- Consider restricting access to the Swagger UI in production environments
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate potential XSS attacks
- Implement authentication for API documentation in production

This update should be prioritized as part of the next maintenance cycle.
